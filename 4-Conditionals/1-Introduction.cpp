/*
--> How to take input ? 
    In C++ we take input by using cin object.
    cin stands for character input or console input.

    cin >> variableName ; 


--> Advantage of data type

    The data type tells the compiler how many it has to read since all the data is stored
    in binary format.

    The data type also tells the compiler that it has to convert the binary number into
    a specific data type like int or char or bool or float.
