--> Machine language : it is the language that the computer understands.
    If someone ask what is the computer language's , than tell them that it's 
    machine language.

    Machine language is nothing but the binary language.A machine language is nothing
    but 0 or 1.

    Need of high level langauge ? 

    Note : Computer only understands binary language.Now to perform something by
    the computer or to instruct computer we need to write the instructions in 
    binary form that the computer can understand.It is very difficult to write
    , learn and understand the binary or machine language.That's why to solve this 
    problem we use high level languages.We use a language that we can easily learn and
    understand.A high level language is a language that is easy to learn and understand.
    We use a software which is assembler/compiler 
    which act as a translator that converts the high level instructions to low level or 
    machine or binary langauge that the computer can understands.

--> High level language : a language that is easy to read and learn and human understandable.
--> Low level language : a language that uses some symbols to write commands like ADD B ; 
--> Machine languae : a language where we code by using 0 and 1.It is tough to read and write and takes
    more time as we have to write more code.
    
--> Assembler : a program that converts assembly language or low level language to machine language.
    Ex : ADD A ; 
    This is the example of assembly language code.

--> Compiler : a program that converts high level language to machine language at one go.

--> Interpreter : a program that converts high level language to machine language line by line and it
    execute each line after conversion.
    Each line is converted to machine code and each machine code line is executed at the same time.

--> Compiler converts the code to machine code at one go and than execute the machine code.
    Interpreter do conversion line by line and after each line conversion , it executes that 
    converted machine code.
