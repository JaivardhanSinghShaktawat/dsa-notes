--> How Transistor Works ? 

    A transistor is a device that stores a charge or 1bit.It stores either 1 or 0.
    Note : In computer everything that we store like music , movies , images , 
    etc , computer stores all of them in binary number system.Computer only 
    understands binary number system.

    By using the binary number system , we can store a lot of numbers and data.

    Ex : Suppose we have two transistors.

    _ _

    In each transistor i have two options , either to choose 1 or 0.

    0 0
    1 0
    0 1
    1 1

    So total different numbers we can store in two transistors are 2^2 = 4
    The maximum number that we can store in the two transistor are 2^2 - 1.This is 
    because we can also store 0.To store 4 , we will need 3 transistors.

    We don't use decimal number system in computer because we can store less numbers
    only.But by the concept of binary number we can store a lot of numbers.
    By using the concept of transistor we can store the maximum decimal number in 
    least transistors because now we have two options either to store 0 or 1 in 
    transistors.

    Computer only understands binary language.

--> Moore's Law ? 
    This law states that every two years , the capacity of the transistors will get
    doubled.This was said by him around 1965.

    Ex : suppose we have a RAM which have 1MB size.Than after two years the RAM
    size will increae to 2MB , than next 2 years it will be 4MB and so on.
    This thing is still true.

    Every year the capacity of the transistors are increasing and this is because the
    size of the transistors are going decreasing year by year.
