/*
--> Advantage of compiler

    1. Convert high level code to machine code.
    2. Display errors like syntax errors , runtime errors etc.
    3. Optimize the code as well.

--> How transistor stores data ? 
    A transistor is a device that stores 1 bit.Each transistor stores 1 bit.It can 
    store 0 or 1.
    A transistor tells whether a charge is present or not.  

    Note : Our data is stored in the transistor only.

    Ex : To store 5 in memory , we will convert it binary which is 0101.

    Now each transistor will store the bit of the 5.

    The smallest unit in computer memory is 1 bit.

    1 bit = Binary Representation

    8 bit = 1 byte
    1024 byte = 1KB
    1024KB = 1MB
    1024MB = 1GB
    1024GB = 1TB
    1024TB = 1PB

    In Computer everthing is stored in bits and bytes.

--> What is ASCII table ? 
    ASCII stands for American standard code for information interchange.
    Since computer stores everything in bits in memory.To store characters like
    'A' etc.We map an integer value with each character.The table which stores the
    characters and their mapped integer value is called as ASCII value.

    So when we have to store 'A' in computer , we store 65 in computer.Because 65
    is the ASCII value of 'A'.65 is stored in computer memory in binary representation
    form.

    There are total 256 characters in ASCII table.The value starts from 0 to 255.

    Note : Whole world follows this ASCII table and ASCII is the standard that we 
    use while working with characters.

    The characters from '0' to '9' starts from 48.
    The 0 is the null character ASCII value.
    The characters "A" starts from 65
    The characters "a" starts from 97
