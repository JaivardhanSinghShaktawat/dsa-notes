--> How to approach a problem ?
   
    1. read & understand the problem
    2. read the inputs and constraints.
    3. create a rough solution and dry run it.
    4. code it
    5. find errors and debug it
    6. optimize the solution by using other solutions.

--> What is a Flowchart ? 
    A flowchart is the diagrametic representation of any solution or algorithm.
    We use different diagrams to represent the approach or solution.

--> Components Of Flowchart

    1. Terminal/Terminator : It is oval in shape.It is used to start and to end the
    program.

    2. Parallelogram : It is used for input and output.To take input and to output
    the result we use it.It is called as input output block.

    3. Rectangle : It is used for processing like i = i + 1 ; 
    Here we do calculation , initialization , declaration , processing , updation.
    It is called as process block.

    4. Diamond : It is called decision making block.It is used when we have to make
    some decision based on some condition.This block always contains some 
    condition.

    5. Arrows : It is used to connect the different component of the flowchart and
    it also shows the flow of the flowchart/program.
    The arrows show the flow of execution.

    6. Connector : It is used with functions.We can connect different flowcharts using
    the connector.

--> Problems solving with Flowcharts

    1. Sum of two numbers
    2. Average of two numbers
    3. Find cube of a number
    4. Find square of a number
    5. Number is even or odd
    6. Number is positive or negative
    7. Print a number 10 times
    8. Print n natural numbers
    9. Sum of n natural numbers
    10. Check if a number is prime or not.
  
--> What is pseudocode ? 
    It is the way to represent any solution which is generic.
    We explain solution by using english words only.

    We use flowchart and pseudocode to explain our solution to other people and can dry 
    run the code.
